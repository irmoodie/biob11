title: "BIOB11 - Experimental Design and Analysis for Biologists"

Welcome to the course website for BIOB11. Here you will find all materials used in the course.

All course communication should take place on [LU Canvas](https://canvas.education.lu.se/courses/33414). This site is only for hosting interactive materials that are not easy to distribute as files via Canvas.

This website uses the [`webR`](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) WebAssembly engines to dynamically execute R code in your web browser so I can provide you with interactive exercises.^[This means with a slow internet connection, or a slower browser/computer (especially mobile devices that place restricitons on browser RAM usage), you may experience a delay between loading a page and being able to use the interactive R console, and/or a delay in executing code in the R console. If you have any issues, let the course teacher know.]
