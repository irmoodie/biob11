It provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easier to write, debug, and visualize R code. RStudio includes features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and tools for plotting, history, and workspace management. While R can be used on its own, RStudio enhances the user experience and productivity by providing a more organized and efficient workflow.\nTo use a car as a metaphor, R is the engine, and RStudio is the steering wheel, pedals, gear shifter, etc. It gives us a much easier way to interface and work with R.\nSo you need to install both. RStudio does nothing without R (like a car without an engine)."

Follow the steps in the appropriate section. If you already have R installed, I suggest you check it is up to date. To do that, open R and type R.version. If your major version is 4, then that should be OK for this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual download\n\nGo to the CRAN R Project website.\nClick on the “Download R for Windows” link.\nClick on the “base” link to download the base system.\nClick on the “Download R-x.x.x for Windows” link (where x.x.x is the latest version).\nOnce the download is complete, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\n\n\n\nWinget\nIf you use the package manager winget, you can run the following command to install R:\nwinget install -e --id RProject.R\n\n\nChocolatey\nIf you use the package manager chocolatey, you can run the following command to install R:\nchoco install r.project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual download\n\nGo to the CRAN R Project website.\nClick on the “Download R for macOS” link.\nClick on the .pkg file link to download the installer for the latest version of R.\n\nIf you have a newer Mac with an Apple silicon CPU (M1, M2, M3, M4, etc), you must download the version specifically for Apple silicon CPU Macs that has arm64 in the package name (e.g. R-4.4.3-arm64.pkg).\nIf you have an older Mac with an Intel CPU (i3, i5, i7, etc), you must download the version specifically for Intel CPU Macs that has x86_64 in the package name (e.g. R-4.4.3-x86_64.pkg).\n\nOnce the download is complete, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\n\n\n\nHomebrew\nIf you use homebrew, you can install R and dependencies via:\nbrew install r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebian\nRun the following commands in your terminal:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install r-base r-base-dev\nFor issues, check the dedicated Debian CRAN R Project website.\n\n\nFedora/Redhat\nsudo dnf install R\nFor issues, check the dedicated Fedora CRAN R Project website.\n\n\nUbuntu\n# update indices\nsudo apt update -qq\n# install two helper packages we need\nsudo apt install --no-install-recommends software-properties-common dirmngr\n# add the signing key (by Michael Rutter) for these repos\n# To verify key, run gpg --show-keys /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc \n# Fingerprint: E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9\nwget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc\n# add the repo from CRAN -- lsb_release adjusts to 'noble' or 'jammy' or ... as needed\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)-cran40/\"\n# install R itself\nsudo apt install --no-install-recommends r-base\nFor issues, check the dedicated Ubuntu CRAN R Project website.\n\n\nOther linux distros\nIf you are using a Linux distro other than the ones above, I trust you probably know enough to figure out how to install R yourself. Just be cautious as to the version of R you are installing. For this course, it needs to be &gt;= 4.0. If you have any issues, let the teacher know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChromeOS\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a lot more complicated, sorry.\nYou have three options:\n\nBorrow a windows laptop from the IT department. This would be my first recommendation. But if you want to be able to use your own computer, see the next two options.\nTry and install R locally, using a linux container. This can work, but only reliably for Chromebooks that use an Intel/AMD CPU (not an ARM CPU). Ask the teacher if you are unsure.\nYou use R online instead. This has a few drawbacks depending on the method you use:\n\nYou use webR IDE. This should work for everything we do in the class, but if you accidentally refresh your page or close your browser without saving your work locally, it will be lost.\nYou use Posit Cloud. The free tier should be enough for everything we do here. The downside is you need an internet connection to use it.\nUsing Google Colab. The free tier should again be enough for everything in this class, however the interface is going to be very different.\n\n\n\nInstalling R locally (via a linux container)\nI suggest you follow this guide carefully (it will take some time). Ask the teacher if you are stuck.\n\n\nUsing webR IDE\nThis is a “proof-of-concept” tool, and is not actually intended to be used for real data analysis. However, it is very functional, and we can use it for almost everything in this class. The place where things will be different is when it comes to making Rmarkdown files. This is not supported, but you can still write R scripts with comments, which is fine. You can find it here. However, I would really suggest just using a borrowed laptop over this option.\n\n\nUsing Posit Cloud\nPosit are the company that make RStudio, and they offer a version of it online that works almost identically to the desktop version. All your computations are performed on Posit servers, and with the free plan, you are limited with how much compute time you can use per month. However, the default should be enough for this course. However, I would really suggest just using a borrowed laptop over this option. If you want to use it, you can find it here.\n\n\nGoogle Colab\nColab uses Jupyter to run R code. It is a bit different to the RStudio interface. I personally find that Colab can be very frustrating if you are not a paying user, as you often have to “queue” for a CPU for your code to run on. If you really want to use this (if you are familiar with python/jupyter it might be very intuative), here is a guide to setup R with Colab, and here is a link to Colab itself. However, I would really suggest just using a borrowed laptop over this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPadOS\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no way to run R natively on your device. I strongly suggest you borrow a laptop from the IT department. If you really want to try using your own device, you can access R online.

Its flexibility and extensive capabilities make it a staple in almost all fields within biology, both in academia and in industries. A huge reason for this is that R is free to use, and as such has a global community continually developing new tools and resources tailored to scientific research.\n\n\nR can be used in a number of ways.

    "text": "Programming concepts\nWhile it is not required to be an experienced computer programmer to use R, there is still a set of basic programming concepts that new R users need to understand. We will cover these first. You do not need to memorise these things.\n\nObjects\nIn R, data can be stored in objects. An object can be thought of as a container that holds data. You can create an object by assigning a value to a name using the assignment operator &lt;-. In the example below, I assign the value 5 to the object x, and the value 10 to the object y. We can then perform maths or other operations using these objects. Calculate the sum of x and y using + on the line below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx &lt;- 5\ny &lt;- 10\nx + y\n\n\n\n\nAdd a third object called z and assign it the value 12. Write a math equation that will output the value 24, using x, y, and z only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx &lt;- 5\ny &lt;- 10\nz &lt;- 12\n\ny / x * z\n\n\n\n\nObjects can hold any sort of data in R. It could be a single value like in the above example, multiple values, text, a whole dataset, or a plot.\n\n\nData types\nIn R, data can come in various types, and it’s important to understand these types to manipulate and analyse data effectively. Here are some of the most common data types in R:\n\nNumeric: Represents numbers and can be either integers or floating-point numbers. For example, 42 and 3.14 are numeric values.\nCharacter: Represents text or string data. Character values are enclosed in quotes, such as \"Hello, world!\".\nLogical: Represents boolean values, which can be either TRUE or FALSE.\nFactor: Used to represent categorical data. Factors are useful for storing data that has a fixed number of unique values, such as “Species A” and “Species B” for species ID.\n\nNote that these are similar, but conceptually different, to the variables types we covered in the lecture. However, the variable types we covered are often encoded in R using these data types:\n\nCategorical variables:\n\nNominal: we will generally use either a character or a factor data type. If used in a statistical test or to make a plot, character data is usually automatically converted to a factor. If your nominal variable is represented by a number (e.g., Forest 1,2,3…), then it is usually best to explicitly convert it to either a character or a factor.\nOrdinal: must be a factor, as you can set the order of the levels witin the factor to the intended order. By default, the order will be determined by alpha-numeric order (A,B,C, 1,2,3).\n\nQuantitative variables\n\nDiscrete: numeric, and specifically, an integer. R will infer the type of numeric data (integer or double (with decimal)) from the data.\nContinuous: numeric, and specifically, a double.\n\n\n\n\nVectors\nVectors are one of the most basic data structures in R. A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. We will sometimes directly use vectors in this course, so it will be good to be familiar with them.\n\nCreating Vectors: You can create a vector using the c() function, which stands for “combine” or “concatenate”. For example, here I create 3 vectors, and assign them to different objects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Elements: You can access elements (position) of a vector using square brackets []. For example, to access the second element of character_vector:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in R, the first position is [1], not [0] like in some programming languages.\nVector Operations: You can perform operations on vectors. These operations are applied element-wise. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that every value in the vector gets multiplied and returned.\nVector Length: You can find the length (number of values in it) of a vector using the length() function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataframes\nDataframes are like spreadsheets. They have rows and columns, and all columns are the same length. These are the primary way we will represent data in this course.\n\n\n\nspecies\nmass_g\nsex\n\n\n\n\nblue_tit\n9.1\nmale\n\n\nblue_tit\n10.6\nmale\n\n\nsparrow\n27.3\nfemale\n\n\n\nWe will come back to them soon.\n\n\nBoolean and logical operators\nBoolean operators are used to perform logical operations and return boolean values (TRUE or FALSE). We will use them in this course to describe our hypotheses. Here are the most common boolean operators in R:\n\nComparison Operators: These operators compare two values and return a boolean value.\n\n== : Equal to\n!= : Not equal to\n&lt; : Less than\n&gt; : Greater than\n&lt;= : Less than or equal to\n&gt;= : Greater than or equal to\n\n\nFor example, this bit of code should evaluate to TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this should be FALSE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the operators above to fill in the blanks below such that the code will evaluate to TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100 == 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- 48\n\n8 + p == 56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq &lt;- 24\nr &lt;- 88\n\n1q + 65 &gt; r\n\n1\n\nAny number &gt; 64 will work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now add in some logical operators:\n\nLogical Operators: These operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions.\n\n& : Logical AND\n| : Logical OR\n! : Logical NOT\n\n\nFor example, this bit of code should evaluate to TRUE, because both the first part 1 + 3 == 4 and the second part 5 &gt;= 4 is TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas this evaluates to FALSE, because only the first part is TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if we change the & to an OR operator |, it evaluates to TRUE because at least one part of it is TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the operators above to fill in the blanks below such that the code will evaluate to TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfruit_a &lt;- \"apple\"\nfruit_b &lt;- \"banana\"\n\n1(fruit_a != fruit_b) & (1.5 &gt; 1.2)\n\n1\n\nOR | would also work here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfruit_a &lt;- \"apple\"\nfruit_b &lt;- \"banana\"\n\n(fruit_a == fruit_a) | (35 + 12 &gt; 47)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\nFunctions perform tasks in R. Functions can take inputs, called arguments, and return outputs. We put the arguments inside the brackets. For example, in R there is a function called mean(). This function’s first argument x should be a vector of numeric data. The function then outputs the mean as a single numeric value. For example, here we assign a vector of tree heights (cm) to an object called trees. We then calculate the mean tree height using the mean() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if we are going to supply arguments in the order that the function expects them, we do not have to tell the function which object is for each argument. Since mean() expects the first argument to be the vector you want the mean of, we can also write:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find out what a function can do, and its arguments, use can write ?function_name, and the R helpfile will be returned for that function (e.g., ?mean). These helpfiles can be confusing at first, but the more you use R, the more they will make sense.\nWe will work with functions a lot in this course, so don’t worry if it still seems confusing.\n\n\nPipes\nOne of the final concepts I will introduce is the pipe operator |&gt;. Note that you will often see it written as %&gt;% when searching online. This is for historical reasons (R by default did not have a pipe operator until recently, so people had made their own). |&gt; comes with R by default now, while %&gt;% requires you to load a package called magrittr first (we will cover packages soon).\nPipes allow you to write code in a way that often makes more sense to people, especially non-programmers. To explain, here’s an example. Note that this is not real code, so you cannot run it.\nSay I wanted to run 3 different functions on a dataframe called my_data. The functions are function_1(), function_2(), and function_3(). Imagine function_1() first transforms my data into the right scale, function_2() then performs a statistical test, and function_3() then makes a plot (again, these are not real functions, just for the example).\nI could write that in a few ways. The first way would look like this:\n\n1my_data_1 &lt;- function_1(my_data)\n2my_data_2 &lt;- function_2(my_data_1)\n3my_data_final &lt;- function_3(my_data_2)\n\n\n1\n\nThe original data, my_data, is passed to function_1(), and the result is stored in my_data_1.\n\n2\n\nThe transformed data, my_data_1, is then passed to function_2(), and the result is stored in my_data_2.\n\n3\n\nFinally, the data from my_data_2 is passed to function_3(), and the result is stored in my_data_final.\n\n\n\n\nWhile this method is quite clear to read, it creates a lot of objects that we might not want to do anything with. This is not a huge issue, but could become one if you are working with very large data sets.\nWe could also write it like this:\n\nmy_data_final &lt;- function_3(function_2(function_1(my_data)))\n\nWe can wrap functions within functions to put this whole operation on one line. This gets rid of those extra objects, having only a my_data_final as the output. However, the order in which the functions are written no longer matches the order in which they are run. In the above example, function_1() runs first, then function_2(), then function_3(). But they are written in reverse order when we read it left to right.\nA final method of writing this makes use of pipes |&gt;, and has the best of both approaches:\n\nmy_data_final &lt;- my_data |&gt; function_1() |&gt; function_2() |&gt; function_3()\n\nPipes also allow us to spread our code over multiple lines, and the |&gt; will look for the next bit of code on the next line if nothing comes after it:\n\nmy_data_final &lt;- \n  my_data |&gt; \n  function_1() |&gt; \n  function_2() |&gt; \n  function_3()\n\nAll the above examples have the same my_data_final output, but are just written in different ways. The computer reads them all identically, so the main benefit is how readable your code is.\nIn this course, we will use pipes extensively, along with a set of packages that are designed for this kind of workflow. Below, rewrite the examples to use pipes. You can check the solutions tab to see if you are on the right track:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1trees |&gt; mean()\n\n1\n\nTake the trees vector, and then pipe|&gt; it into the mean() function.\n\n\n\nThe log() function performs a natural logarithm transformation of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1trees |&gt;\n  log() |&gt;\n  mean() \n\n1\n\nTake the trees vector, and then pipe|&gt; it into the log() function, then into the mean() function.\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages\nAn R package is a set of functions, data and/or information that someone else has written, that you can first load, then use in your own R code. Packages are written by other R users, and distributed for free via repositories, like The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\nR packages are often used to save you time. While all the functions in an R package are written with R, and you could write them again yourself, why bother? If someone else has done it already and shared it, fantastic! In this course, we are going to use two package “families”. They are tidyverse and tidymodels. Note that both start with tidy. Remember from the lecture, that tidy refers to a particular format of data, and these packages all assume your data will be in the format, and will always return data in that format. They are also all built with pipes in mind, and are designed to make complex programming tasks (especially those performed by data scientists, of which biology fits in well) very easy. We will cover these packages in detail soon, but know to use them you need to do two things:\n\nInstall the package. This needs to be done once on your computer, using the install.packages() command. For examples:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\nThis will install ggplot2, a package for plotting data. It will install it from CRAN by default, and probably (assuming you are in Sweden) will be downloaded from a server in Umeå.\n\nWe now need to load the package, so that we can access it while we write code. To do that, we use the library() function.\n\n\n1library(ggplot2)\n\n\n1\n\nNote that we no longer require the \" around the package name. But the function would still work if you did include them.\n\n\n\n\nBelow I have written some code that makes a plot using an inbuilt R dataset called iris using the package ggplot2. But if you try to run it, you will get an error. The ggplot2 package has already been installed, so fix the code by loading the ggplot2 package before the code that makes the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1library(ggplot2)\niris |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n1\n\nMake sure to load the ggplot2 package before the ggplot() function. Code is always executed top to bottom.\n\n\n\nThat was a lot of concepts in a very short amount of time! Take a well deserved break before the next exercise."

    "section": "The grammer of graphics",
    "text": "The grammer of graphics\nThe grammer of graphics gives us a way to describe any plot. ggplot2 then allows us to make that plot, using a layered approach to the grammer of graphics.\nUsing this approach, we can say a statistical graphic is a mapping of data variables to aesthetic attributes of geometric objects (Chester et al. 2025).\nWow. What does that mean? Let’s break it down.\nA ggplot2 plot has three essential components:\n\ndata: the dataset that contains the variables you want to plot\ngeom: the geometric object you want to use to display your data (e.g. a point, a line, a bar).\naes: aesthetic attributes that you want to map to your geometric object. For example, the x and y location of a point geometry could be mapped to two variables in your dataset, and the colour of those points could be mapped to a third.\n\nAs I said before, ggplot2 uses a layered approach to the grammer of graphics. This makes it very easy to start contructing plots by putting together a “recipe” step-by-step. Let’s walk through an example.\n\nWe want to make a scatterplot that shows the relationship between body_mass_g and bill_length_mm. Imagine we are interested to see if bigger penguins also have bigger bills? (We will do correlation analysis later on in the course, this is just a nice example for learning ggplot2).\nLet’s map out what we need to describe that plot:\n\ndata is the penguins dataset, as that is where the body_mass_g and bill_length_mm variables are.\ngeom we are going to represent the data using a point, as we are making a scatter plot.\naes is how we describe where each point should be. For this example, we could map the x (horizontal position) of the point to body_mass_g and the y position (vertical position) to bill_length_mm.\n\nSo now we have the recipe, let’s start building layer by layer. First we will add the data by providing it to the ggplot() function as an argument. Try running this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, beautiful! But perhaps some things are missing. Let’s map our data. We use the aes() to tell R that everything inside it is going to be used as an aesthetic mapping, and that the names of the variables we mention come from the dataframe. We then provide that to ggplot()’s mapping argument, as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, still not quite there. We need to actually show the data! We need to add some geometry. To do that we, use the + operator. While this is usually reserved for maths, ggplot2 hijacks it to add layers to a plot. We can add a point geometry like this (you might need to use the hoziontal scroll wheel to see the end of the first line):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking good! Notice you got a warning. The warning is important to pay attention to, as it is telling you that two rows (penguins) have not been plotted, as they contain missing values. These are the NA values we talked about earlier. Two penguins must have had an NA for at least one of our plotting variables, body_mass_g or bill_length_mm (as we need both to place the point).\nLet’s add one more aesthetic to our data. Our dataset contained data for three different penguin species. Let’s map species to the colour of our points.\nYou need to modify the code above by adding a 3rd argument within the aes() function. In R, we seperate arguments within functions with a , as you can see between x = body_mass_g and y = bill_length_mm. Add another , then write colour = species. Then re-run the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, colour = species)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n1\n\nAdd colour as a third aesthetic, mapped to species\n\n\n\nYou notice we now have a legend that tells us which colour is which species. ggplot2 has also chosen a default colour scheme for us.\nAnswer the following questions:\n\nIf someone told you that heavier penguins tend to have longer bills, and showed you this graph as proof, would you believe them? Why? Do you think this applies to all penguin species in the dataset?\nModify the code above to instead show bill_depth_mm on the x axis. Which penguin species do you think match each bill description?\n\nShort and wide bills\nLong and wide bills\nLong and narrow bills\n\n\n\nLet’s get back to understanding each of the variables. For continuous variables, a histogram is a good place to start, as it shows us the range and the shape of the distribution. To make a histogram with ggplot, we use geom_histogram() as our geometry. geom_histogram() is a bit of a special geom_, as it does all the calculations needed to make a histogram for us, such as binning our data and counting the number of bits of data in each bin. We also need to only provide an x aesthetic value, and the y value is calculated for us by geom_histogram().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n1ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n1\n\nReplace the variable assinged to x with the variable you want to plot.\n\n\n\nNotice we get the warning again, that data (NA values) have been removed.\nCopy and modify the above code to show the other continuous variables.\n\nDo they all look like bell-shaped (normal) distributions? Are any very different from a normal distribution (e.g., has more than one distinct peaks)? Can you think why this might be?\n\n\nNow let’s look at our other variables. species and island and sex seem to be categorical nominal variables, each with three different categories. What about year? It’s integer data (1,2,3, etc) so that might suggest we should treat it like a quantitative discrete variable. But, it only has three levels across the entire dataset. This suggests to me that it instead is a categorical ordinal variable. It is the year the penguin was caught and measured. I think you could also make an arguement that this is not an ordinal variable, and instead is nominal. It would depend if you think penguins in 2007 are going to be more similar to penguins in 2008, than penguins in 2009 (maybe because of gradual changes in climate), or if you think any differences between years would be random (maybe some years are better or worse than others, but this is not predictable). Either way, we can also visualise it using the same method.\nLet’s look at how much of our data comes from each category in each variable. To do that, we could use a bar chart. Like geom_histogram(), geom_bar() does some calculation for us. Specifically, it counts how many rows of data are assigned to each category, and then uses that for our y aesthetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Part 1\nggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n1ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = island)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\nggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = year)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\nggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = sex)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n# Part 2\n2ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = island, fill = species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n1\n\nReplace the variable assinged to x with the variable you want to plot.\n\n2\n\nAdd fill as an aesthetic, and map it to species.\n\n\n\n\nAs you did before, copy and modify the code to make a bar chart for island, sex, and year.\nUsing what you learned to make the first scatter plot, can you add another aesthetic to make a plot that shows what proportion of the penguins on each island are which species? Are all species present on all islands?\n\nHint: Instead of using colour, you might want to try fill. To understand why, try each one!\n\nFinally for plotting today, we will make some box plots. Box plots allow us to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable and to compare distributions across different levels of a categorical variable. A box plot displays the median, quartiles, and potential outliers of the data.\n\nTo create a box plot in ggplot2, we use geom_boxplot(). Again, this is a very helpful geom_, as it does all of the required calculations (median, quartiles, etc) for us.\nUsing what you have learned, try to create this boxplot yourself first (you can copy code from above and modify it). Create a box plot to compare body_mass_g across different species. Think what variables should be assigned to which aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +\n2  geom_boxplot()\n\n1\n\nAssign the variables to the aesthetics.\n\n2\n\nUse the boxplot geom function."

However, they have also been implemented in their own functions, which saves us some time:\n\nmean(): Computes the arithmetic mean of a numeric vector.\nmedian(): Computes the median of a numeric vector.\nmin(): Returns the minimum value in a numeric vector.\nmax(): Returns the maximum value in a numeric vector.\nquantile(): Computes the quantiles of a numeric vector.\n\n1st quartile: quantile(x, prob = 0.25), where x is a numeric vector.\n3rd quartile: quantile(x, prob = 0.75), where x is a numeric vector.\n\nvar(): Computes the variance of a numeric vector.\nsd(): Computes the standard deviation of a numeric vector.\nlength(): Count the number of bits of data in a vector.\n\nNote that most of these function, by default, will produce an error if you have a single NA in the vector. If you use a vector with NA values, you need to explicitly tell the function to remove the NA values, by adding the argument rm.na = TRUE.\nYou’ll notice that each of these take a vector as input (check the last exercise for a review). Each column/variable in our dataframe penguins is actually just a vector. So we can use these functions on individual columns. To do that, we need to extract the column/variable we are interested in, then use the statistic function on it. For example, to calculate the mean of the variable flipper_length_mm, we could write it like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo break down what’s going on here. 1. On the first line, we write the name of the dataframe that contains the variable we want to use. 2.

    "text": "Making tables of descriptive statistics\nOften we want to provide a table of descriptive statistics about our variables. To make our own (beyond what summary() can offer), we need to do a bit of data manipulation. To do that, I need to introduce a few functions from the package dplyr (part of tidyverse), which provides a grammer of data manipulation for us to use. Again, like ggplot2, this grammer is often much easier for non-programmers to understand, and makes doing common tasks easier for everyone.\nIn this next section, we will use the following functions:\n\ngroup_by: all functions that come after this will provide an output for each category in the grouping variable.\nsummarise(): produces a summary table by computing summary statistics on a variable.\n\nLet’s start by constructing a table that will describe the bill_length_mm variable, but we want to compute the statistics for each penguin species. On the first line we write the dataframe name, penguins, which we then pipe |&gt; into the next line. On the second line, we tell R to remove all penguins that have an NA for their bill length. This saves us from needing to write na.rm = TRUE many times. This gets piped |&gt; into the next line, where we specify our grouping variable, which in this case, is species. When then use another pipe |&gt; to send that onto the next line, where we will use summarise() to make a summary table. Inside summarise() we define what summary statistics we want to calculate, and what we want to call them in the output. For example, here we calculate the mean() of bill_length_mm, and tell the function to call it mean_bill_length_mm in the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output contains our new mean_bill_length_mm column, but for each penguin species. We can add other new columns with other descriptive statistics in a similar fashion. Note that instead of making the 4th line very long, we can put new arguments on seperate lines, as long as those lines end with a comma:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npenguins |&gt;\n3  drop_na(bill_length_mm, sex) |&gt;\n2  group_by(species, sex) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    mean_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm),\n1    median_bill_length_mm = median(bill_length_mm),\n    sd_bill_length_mm = sd(bill_length_mm)\n    )\n\n1\n\nNote the comma at the end!\n\n2\n\nNote the comma between the variables!\n\n3\n\nThis remove all rows where sex was NA, removing the unwanted group.\n\n\n\nAdd another column to the output table above that calculates the standard deviation of bill_length_mm.\nWe can add more than one grouping variable, by simply listing it within group_by(). For example, try grouping your output by both species and sex. Note that this produces an potentially unwanted group, how could you get rid of it?"

The first is practical: if you do not have a hypothesis in mind, you’ll likely not collect data in an effective manner and you will waste your time. The second is more fundamental: all statistical tests are based on testing a hypothesis. So, to meaningfully conduct a statistically test, you need a hypothesis.\nThe hypothesis is an explanation for your data. Two types exist:\n\nA null hypothesis, where we assume that the factor we are studying (in this case sex) has no effect on our data.\nAn alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. It states that the factor we are studying (sex) does affect our data.\n\nUsing the above examples, can you phrase both the null and alternative hypotheses?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested hypotheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull hypothesis: Penguins do not differ in size between sexes.\nAlternative hypothesis: Penguins are different in size between sexes."

    "text": "Analysing the data\nWe now want to test if these means (from a sample) likely differ between sexes in our population.\nOne way we can do that is to start by imagining the world in which our null hypothesis is true. In that world, there is no difference between the sexes in your chosen variable. In that world, a penguin being labelled as male or female should have no effect on your chosen variable. In otherwords, if our null hypothesis is true, then randomly assiging sex to each penguin should not alter the difference in means between the sexes.\nThis idea is the foundation of a type of statistical inference called permutation or randomisation testing.\nLet’s try implement it here. To do that, we will use the R package infer (which I have already loaded).\n\n\n\nThe infer design\n\n\n\nCalculating the difference\nFirst, we need to specify() which variables are relevant to our hypothesis. This extracts the data we need to test our hypothesis. We then calculate() the \"diff in means\", specifying that we want to get the difference as male-female. A positive value therefore indicated male biased sexual dimorphism. Fill in the variable you have chosen and run the code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerating data assuming our null hypothesis\nNext, we need to state our null hypothesis. In this case, our null hypothesis is that the explanatory variable sex has no effect on the response variable. Therefore, we hypothesize() (if the null is true) \"independence\" between the explanatory and response variables.\n\nmy_species |&gt;\n  specify(response = ______, explanatory = sex) |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\")\n\nNow, we need to randomly shuffle the sex variable, which if our null hypothesis is true, should have little affect on the difference in means. We also need to do this a lot of times (1000+). First we generate() 1000 datasets where the sex variable has been randomly shuffled (\"permute\"). Then in each of those datasets, we calculate() the difference in means between the sexes, as we did for our deal difference in means above. Fill in the variable you have chosen and run the code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s visualise our null distribution null_diff_means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the distribution of values of sexual dimorphism we could observe if the null hypothesis was true.\n\n\nHow extreme was our real data?\nWe can use the position of the real calculated difference between the sexes in the null distribution to infer how likely our null hypothesis was true. If the null hypothesis is true, then our real difference will probably lie somewhere near the middle of our null distribution, as after all, sex had no effect on the chosen variable.\nHowever, if sex did have an effect on the chosen variable (that is, our alternative hypothesis was correct), then we would expect the original sex assignments to be a very special arrangement. As such, our real difference should lie close to the tails of the null distribution (or maybe far beyond it).\nLet’s plot it now to see. We can use the function shade_p_value() to do this (we will come back to what a p-value is later). We specify the direction = \"two-sided\" because our hypothesis did not make an assumption as to if the sexual dimorphism will be male or female biased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere did your real difference in means end up? Use the above text to decide if you think your null hypothesis, or your alternative hypothesis, is most likely true.\nFinally, phrase your findings in biological terms. What do your findings suggest?\nWhen you are done, show the teacher your findings."

If R does not appear here, I suggest you restart your computer first.\nYou should be met by a scene that looks like this:\n\n\n\nA screenshot of a new RStudio installation on macOS.\n\n\nRstudio is designed around a four panel layout. Currently you can see three of them. To reveal the fourth, go to File -&gt; New file -&gt; R markdown... This will open an RMarkdown document, which is a form of coding “notebook”, where you can mix text, images and code in the same document. We will use these sorts of documents extensively in this course. Give your document a title like “BIOB11 Exercise 4”. You can put your name for author, and leave the rest as default for now. Click OK. Now your window should look something like this:\n\n\n\nA screenshot of RStudio on macOS with an RMarkdown file open, and the panels labelled.\n\n\n\nSource: This is where we edit code related documents. Anything you want to be able to save should be written here.\nConsole: the console is where R lives. This is where any command you write in the source pane and run will be sent to be executed.\nEnvironments: this panel shows you objects loaded into R. For example, if you were to assign a value to an object (e.g.x &lt;- 1), then it would appear here.\nOutput: this panel has many functions, but is commonly used to navigate files, show plots, show a rendered RMarkdown file or to read the R help documentation.\n\n\n\nRMarkdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. It combines plain text with embedded R code chunks that are run when the document is rendered, allowing you to include results and your R code directly in the document. This makes it a powerful tool for creating reproducible analyses, which are extremely important in science.\nThe RMarkdown document you opened has some example text and code. An RMarkdown document consists of three main parts:\n\nYAML Header: This section, enclosed by --- at the beginning and end, contains metadata about the document, such as the title, author, date, and output format.\nText: You can write plain text using Markdown syntax to format it. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, which is easy to read and write.\nCode Chunks: These are sections of R code enclosed by triple backticks and {r}. You can click the green arrow to run all the code in a code chunk, or run each line of code using the Run button, or by using Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Cmd+Enter (macOS)When the document is rendered, the code is executed, and the results are included in the output.\n\nNotice at the top left of the Source panel, there are two buttons: Source and Visual. These allow you to switch betwee two views of the RMarkdown document. The Source view is what you are looking at, and it is the raw text document. You can also use the Visual view, which allows you to work in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) view, similar to Microsoft Office or other text editors. This “renders” your markdown code for you while you write. It also gives you a series of menus to help you format text, which means you do not need to learn how to write markdown code (although it is extremely simple, and you likely know some already).\nWhich ever view you prefer (and you can switch as often as you like), the code part stays the same. It is primarily there for editing the text around your code.\n\n\n\nBefore we go any further, we need to change some default settings in RStudio.\nGo to Tools -&gt; Global Settings, then:\n\nGo to the General tab.\n\nUn-tick “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”\nSet “Save workspace to RData on exit:” to Never.\n\nGo to the Code tab\n\nTick “Use native pipe operator, l&gt; (requires R 4.1+)”\n\nGo to the RMarkdown tab\n\nUn-tick “Show output inline for all R Markdown documents”\n\n\nWhile we are here, if you wanted to change the font size or theme, you can do that in the Appearance tab.\nRStudio also has screenreader support. You can enable that in the Accessibility tab.\n\n\n\nI strongly recommend you create a folder where you save all the work you do as part of this course. I also recommend you make this folder in a part of your computer that is not being synced with a cloud service (iCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc). These services can cause issues with RStudio. You can always back up your work at the end of a session.\nWithin your new course folder, I also want you to make a new folder for each exercise we do. This will make it very easy for you to stay organsied and submit work you do to me for feedback. It also makes your code reproducible by simply sending someone the contents of the folder in question. For example, this is exercise 4, so my main folder might be called biob11, and within that folder I might make a folder called exercise_4.\nWe now want to set our working directory to this biob11/exercise_4 folder. A working directory is the directory (folder) in a file system where a user is currently working. It is the default location where all your R code will be executed and where files are read from or written to unless specified otherwise. To set the working directory using RStudio, go to Session -&gt; Set working directory -&gt; Choose directory, then navigate to the folder you just made for this exercise. You should do this at the start of each exercise.\nNotice that now in your Output pane, in the files tab, you can see the contents of your folder (which is probably nothing currently). Let’s change that.\n\n\n\nLet’s save this example RMarkdown document that RStudio has made for us. You do that exactly how you might expect. Go to File -&gt; Save, or use the floppy disc icon. Ensure you save it in your working directory with a descriptive name (e.g. exercise_4.Rmd).

But they do have to be plausible to be kept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich variables do you think might have incorrectly entered data?\nWe will use a filter() function to inspect rows that contain improbably values. filter() let’s us write conditional statements (from Exercise 1) that only allow rows that meet those conditions to “filter” through. For example, we could use filter to see all rows where wing_length_mm is greater than our guess at what the maximum should be. Looking at the histogram of wing_length_mm, and with the knowledge that these flies are &lt; 1 cm in size, adapt the following code to just show you the suspicious rows:\n\n1tephritis_data |&gt; filter(wing_length_mm &gt; _____)\n\n\n1\n\nThis will only let though rows that have a wing_length_mm greater than &gt; _____\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think? Do these values seem real, or are they probably mistakes? Use the code above to check your other suspicious variables. If you think these values are mistakes, then we need to get rid of them.\nAn easy way to do that is to use filter() again, but this time, to only allow rows that do have plausible values to “filter” through. That is, we can reverse the greater than &gt; to a less than &lt;. If we wanted to set a lower limit, we could that by using the & operator (from Exercise 1). We can also chain together filter() functions using pipes |&gt; to clean up our dataset in one go. Adapt the code below to clean up the dataset:\n\n1clean_data &lt;-\n  tephritis_data |&gt; \n  filter(wing_length_mm &lt; _____) |&gt;\n2  filter(______ ______ ______)\n\n\n1\n\nI assigned the cleaned data to a new object, called clean_data.\n\n2\n\nYou can add more filter() functions as you wish.\n\n\n\n\nUse the summary() function again, and make some plots to show that your data cleaning has had the desired effect."

For example, you might want to change the labels of the axis, or give your plot a title. You can do that using the labs() function:\n\nggplot(example_data, aes(x = variable_1, y = variable_2)) +\ngeom_points() +\nlabs(x = \"Name of my x variable\", y = \"Name of my Y variable\", title = \"My awesome plot\")\n\nYou can also change the theme of your plot. ggplot2 has many built in themes.

For my fake example, I could change the theme to theme_classic() like this:\n\nggplot(example_data, aes(x = variable_1, y = variable_2)) +\ngeom_points() +\ntheme_classic()\n\nTry it out on your plots. What theme do you prefer best?\nIn general, ggplot2 is a very widely used plotting package, so finding examples of what you want to do will not be hard. Use search engines, AI tools, the ggplot2 book, etc. If you see it on your plot, you can probably change it."

    "text": "Data analysis\nWe will finish this exercise with an analysis similar to Exercise 2. Again, we will cover the theory behind these analyses more in depth during the lectures.\nMake a new section in your R markdown file, with a new code cell(s). Make notes outside the code cells which you can refer back to at a later date.\nRecall that the researchers measured flies that live in two different host plants. Although they are the same species, the use of these two different host plants functionally splits the species into two “host races”, that do not reproduce with each other.\nSuppose the researchers have evidence to suggest that, before the species was split by colonizing these two host plants, the ancestral fly had a mean ovipositor length of 1.79 mm. The researchers want to know if either of the two host races have evolved a different ovipositor length, perhaps to better adapt to their new host plants.\nFor now, let’s focus on the heterophyllum host race.\nWe want to answer the question:\nIs the mean ovipositor_length_mm in the heterophyllum host race different from 1.79 mm?\n\nHypotheses\nFrom this research question:\n\nWhat population are we making inferences about?\nWhat is the null hypothesis?\nWhat is the alternative hypothesis?\n\n\n\nCollecting data\nAs we are just interested in the flies that hatched from the heterophyllum host_plant, we should first make a subset of our data that is just the data we are going to use. Use filter() to create a dataset that only has:\n\nflies that hatched from the heterophyllum host_plant\nfemale sex flies (as males do not have ovipositors)\n\nThe conditional statement == will be useful here.\nName this dataset something meaninful, like heterophyllum_data, or maybe something shorter if you prefer, like h_data.\n\n\nPlotting data\nUsing this new dataframe, make a plot that illustrates your hypothesis.\n\n\nCalculating the test statistic\nFirst, we need to know what our test statistic, in this case the mean ovipositor_length_mm length we observe in our sample is. This is called our observed (test) statistic. To calculate this, we can use specify() and calculate(). First, we should pipe |&gt; our filtered dataset into the specify() function. Inside specify(), we need to declare which variable we are interested in. In this case, we only have a response variable, as we are just working with the mean of one group. We then pipe |&gt; that into calculate(), where we declare the name of our chosen test statistic. We save it as observed_mean_h, as we want to use it later to compare against a null distribution.\n\nobserved_mean_h &lt;- \n  ____________ |&gt;\n  specify(response = ______) |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"______\")\n\nobserved_mean_h\n\n\n\nSimulating data under the null hypothesis\nNext we need a null distribution to compare with. First, we need to imagine that the null hypothesis is true. In this case, that mean ovipositor_length_mm == 1.79. To do that, we create a new dataset from our sample, where the mean ovipositor_length_mm == 1.79. We do that by using the difference between the mean in our sample 1.76 and mean we want to test against (1.79) to shift our data such that it is compatible with the null hypothesis. We then draw “bootstrap” replicates (sampling with replacement) from this new data and calculate our test statistic (mean) each time. Like in the example in exercise 2, we need to do this a lot of times to generate an appropriate null distribution (in this case, 10000 times).\n\nnull_dist_h &lt;-\n  ______ |&gt;\n  specify(response = ______) |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"point\", mu = ______) |&gt;\n  generate(reps = ______, type = \"bootstrap\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"______\")\n\n\n\nComparing our observed statistic to the null distribution\nWe can now use visualize() to show our null distribution, and the function shade_p_value() to show our observed statistic, and the proportion of the null distribution that is more extreme than our observed statistic. The direction you choose relates to your original alternative hypothesis.\n\nIf your alternative hypothesis was that there would be a difference from 1.79 mm, but you didn’t specifiy if the evolved ovipositor would be longer or shorter (i.e., you didn’t predict a direction), then you should write \"two-sided\".\nIf your alternative hypothesis was that the evolved ovipositor would be longer, then your hypothesis was one-sided, and you should write \"greater\".\nIf your alternative hypothesis was that the evolved ovipositor would be shorter, then your hypothesis was one-sided, and you should write \"lesser\".\n\n\nnull_dist_h |&gt;\n  visualize() + \n  shade_p_value(observed_mean_h, direction = \"______\")\n\nWe can also calculate from this what our “p-value” is. In this case, our p-value corresponds to the proportion of the null distribution that as extreme, or more extreme than our observed statistic. You can think of it being the probability we would observe data (i.e., collect our sample) if the null hypothesis was true. The closer it is to 0, the more confident we are that the null-hypothesis is not correct.\n\nnull_dist_h |&gt;\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_mean_h, direction = \"______\")\n\nWrite a few sentence to describe the outcome of your test. In addition to the describing the test, also phrase your findings in terms that a friend who isn’t taking this class could understand (i.e., what do your findings suggest, related back to the original question)."
