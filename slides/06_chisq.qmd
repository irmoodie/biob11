## Tests of proportion
### Could a proportion have been observed under a null hypothesis?

- Null hypothesis:
  - BIOB11 does not differ in their preference for cats vs dogs from the Swedish population
- Alternative hypothesis:
  - BIOB11 does differ in their preference for cats vs dogs from the Swedish population

## Tests of proportion

## Tests of proportion
### Could a proportion have been observed under a null hypothesis?

Calculate the test statistic:

```{r}
#| echo: true
observed_stat <-
  animal_pref |>
  specify(response = preference, success = "dog") |>
  calculate(stat = "prop")

observed_stat
```

## Tests of proportion
### Could a proportion have been observed under a null hypothesis?

Generate a null distibution:

```{r}
#| echo: true
null_dist <-
  animal_pref |>
  specify(response = preference, success = "dog") |>
  hypothesize(null = "point", p = 0.58) |>
  generate(reps = 20000, type = "draw") |>
  calculate(stat = "prop")
```

## Tests of proportion
### Could a proportion have been observed under a null hypothesis?

Visualise the null:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center

  visualize(bins = 20) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "two-sided")
```

Calculate the p-value:

  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "two-sided")
```

![](images/06/mendel.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## $\chi^2$ Goodness of fit
### Does the observed data differ from an expected distribution?

- Null hypothesis:
  - The sample came from the hypothesised distribution
  - The sample distribution is not different from the hypothesised distribution
- Alternative hypotheis:
  - The sample came from a different distribution to the one hypothesised
  - The sample distribution is different from the hypothesised distribution

## $\chi^2$ Goodness of fit
### Does the observed data differ from an expected distribution?

```{r}
# Generate expected data under Mendelian laws for a dihybrid cross
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility

# Define expected proportions for a dihybrid cross (9:3:3:1 ratio)
expected_proportions <- c(8.7, 2.5, 3.5, 1.3) / 16

# Generate a dataset with 160 observations (to match proportions)
mendelian_data <- tibble(
  phenotype = rep(
    c("A-B-", "A-bb", "aaB-", "aabb"),
    times = round(expected_proportions * 120)

## $\chi^2$ Goodness of fit
### Does the observed data differ from an expected distribution?

- Fail to reject null hypothesis.
- The distribution of phenotypes is compatible with mendelian inheritance.
