# Welcome to the course!

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### Course rational

- Biology is full of interesting research questions
- Nearly all research in biology relies on collecting and analysing data of some kind
- Experimental design and statistical literacy is therefore important for:
  - ***doing*** your own research
  - ***understanding*** and ***evaluating*** research of other scientists

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### Course aims

- Understand and identify good experimental design that is appropriate to answer a specific research question
- Develop a conceptual understanding of statistics
  - Mathmatical details are not the main focus
  - Developing good statistical judgement is
- Learn how to apply fundemental statistical tools to answer research questions.
  - Using **R**, a free software environment for statistical computing
- Combine everything we have learned to design and carry out a research project

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### After completion of the course you should be able to:

- Explain basic concepts in experimental design, data collection, and data analysis
- Design appropriate biological experiments based on a research question
- Handle and manipulate biological data
- Statistically analyse and interpret biological data
- Present statistical results graphically and in writing

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### How we are going to achieve those aims:

- Lectures that cover key concepts
  - Focus on understanding why
- Exercises that are just data analysis
  - Reinforce key concepts
  - Learn how to apply them
  - Using real biological data

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### How we are going to achieve those aims:

- Writing exercise
  - Apply what you have learned to answer a research question using a dataset
- Exam
  - Open book
- Group project
  - Design your own research questions, collect data, analyse, present

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### Changes from previous years

- We will use **R**, not **SPSS** to perform statistical analyses
  - Both are very powerful statistical software packages
  - A license to use **SPSS** costs > 1060 kr / month
  - **R** is free, and very widely used in biology, both in academia and industry
  - **R** is a programming language
- Introduction of simulation based inference

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### What we expect from you

- Attend as much as you can (note some parts are obligatory)
- Tell us when something isn't clear
- Work together and help each other

  - 1/2 - 1 day of exercises

- Outside of class time:
  - Optional reading
  - Scheduled self-study time

- Project
  - 1 full week to conduct a group research project
  - Research question is totally up to you
  - Need to design an experiment, carry it out, collect data, analyse data, and make a presentation

### Where to find information

- [Canvas](https://canvas.education.lu.se/courses/33414)
  - Announcements
  - Schedule
  - Links to materials
  - Discussion

- Course website (Iain's materials)
  - Will always be linked from Canvas

## Course structure
### How to contact me

- Ask during the exercise sessions or at the end of lectures.
- Outside of exercise sessions, question about course materials: 
  - [Canvas discussions](https://canvas.education.lu.se/courses/33414/discussion_topics)
- Questions you don't want to share with others:
  - Email: [iain.moodie@biol.lu.se](mailto:iain.moodie@biol.lu.se)
  - I will do my best to reply within 24 hours
  - If it is a question about materials, I might ask you to post it in the discussion section so it can be answered there

## Course structure
### Software

- All materials will use **R** and the ***{tidyverse}*** packages
  - This is not a programming course
  - You do not need to mememorise **R** code

## Course structure
