# Welcome to the course!

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### Course rational

- Biology is full of interesting research questions
- Nearly all research in biology relies on collecting and analysing data of some kind
- Experimental design and statistical literacy is therefore important for:
  - ***doing*** your own research
  - ***understanding*** and ***evaluating*** research of other scientists

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### Course aims

- Understand and identify good experimental design that is appropriate to answer a specific research question
- Develop a conceptual understanding of statistics
  - Mathmatical details are not the main focus
  - Instead, developing good statistical judgement is
- Learn how to apply fundemental statistical tools to answer research questions.
  - Using **R**, a free software environment for statistical computing
- Combine everything we have learned to design and carry out a research project

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### After completion of the course you should be able to:

- Explain basic concepts in experimental design, data collection, and data analysis
- Design appropriate biological experiments based on a research question
- Handle and manipulate biological data
- Statistically analyse and interpret biological data
- Present statistical results graphically and in writing

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### How we are going to achieve those aims:

- Learn by doing
  - 

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### What we expect from you

- 

## Experimental design and analysis for biologists
### Changes from previous years

- We will use **R**, not **SPSS** to perform statistical analyses
  - Both are very powerful statistical software packages
  - A license to use **SPSS** costs > 1060 kr / month
  - **R** is free, and very widely used in biology, both in academia and industry
  - **R** is a programming language

## Course structure
### Lectures & exercise sessions

- For each topic:
  - 2 hours of lectures (with a break)
  - 1/2 - 1 day of exercises

- Outside of class time:
  - Optional reading
  - Scheduled self-study time

- Project
  - 1 full week to conduct a group research project
  - Research question is totally up to you
  - Need to design an experiment, carry it out, collect data, analyse data, and make a presentation

## Course structure
### Where to find information

- [Canvas](https://canvas.education.lu.se/courses/33414)
  - Announcements
  - Schedule
  - Links to materials
  - Discussion

- Course website (Iain's materials)
  - Will always be linked from Canvas

## Course structure
### How to contact me

- Ask during the exercise sessions!
- Outside of exercise sessions, question about course materials: 
  - [Canvas discussions](https://canvas.education.lu.se/courses/33414/discussion_topics)
- Questions you don't want to share with others:
  - Send a mail via Canvas
  - If that isn't appropriate, email: [iain.moodie@biol.lu.se](mailto:iain.moodie@biol.lu.se)
  - I will do my best to reply within 24 hours
  - If it is a question about materials, I might ask you to post it in the discussion section so it can be answered there

## Course structure
### Software

- All materials will use **R** and the ***{tidyverse}*** packages
  - This is not a programming course
  - We will only address programming topics when absolutely necessary
  - You do not need to mememorise **R** code

## Course structure
### Literature

- Course book:
  - [Statistical and Data Handling Skills in Biology](https://lubcat.lub.lu.se/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=5164304) (Bio-statistics, with **R** and **SPSS**)


- Free online books
  - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (Using **R** in general)
  - [Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/v2/) (Statistics with **R**)
  - [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) (Statistics with **R**)
  - [Fundamental statistical concepts and techniques in the biological and environmental sciences](https://bradduthie.github.io/stats/) (Bio-statistics, *not* with **R**)


## Homework
### To do before 26th March

- If you are using your own device (Windows, MacOS or Linux):
  - Follow the instructions to install **R** and **RStudio**
- If you are using your own device (ChromeOS, iPadOS, Android, etc)
  - **R** cannot run natively on your device
  - You can access **R** via the browser
  - If your device is "fast", use [**webR IDE**](https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/)
  - If your device is "slow", use [**Posit Cloud**](https://posit.cloud/)
- If you are going to borrow a laptop from the department:
  - Check that it has **RStudio** installed

## Homework
### To do before 26th March

- You do not need **R** installed for the first exercise session.
