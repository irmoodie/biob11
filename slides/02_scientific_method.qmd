## History of the scientific method
### Karl Popper (1902–1994)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Argued that scientific theories must be testable and falsifiable shifting focus from verification to critical testing. This emphasized the provisional nature of scientific knowledge.
- Positive evidence does not prove a hypothesis. Only negative evidence can disprove one.
- A good scientist is one who tries as hard as they can to falsify their hypothesis.

## History of the scientific method
### Hypothesis testing (Laplace, Pearson, Fisher)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- A method of statistical inference used to decide whether the data provide sufficient evidence to reject a particular hypothesis
- Used to answer the question: could our results be just due to chance?

## The process of inquiry
### 1. Make observations

## The process of inquiry
### 1. Make observations

- Observe phenomena in the natural world
- Identify patterns or anomalies that spark curiosity
- Can current ideas explain those phenomena?
  - Are there competing explanations?
- Observations alone are important!

## The process of inquiry
### 2. Formulate a hypothesis

- Identify an observation
- Formulate a hypothesis that could be tested.

## The process of inquiry
### 2. Formulate a hypothesis

From discussion in lecture:

- Does jump height affect the chance of getting a mate?
- Last man standing - does joining later increase chances of getting a mate?
- Does the length of grass where they live affect their jump height, and does this change if the length of grass is changed?
- Does tail feather length increase the chance of mating?

## The process of inquiry
### 2. Formulate a hypothesis

- Develop a testable and falsifiable statement
- Popper: should rely on as few auxiliary hypotheses as possible.
- Which of these hypotheses meet that criteria?
  - "Biodiversity is important"
  - "Apply a pesticide to wheat fields 30 days after sowing seeds is more effective than applying it 10 days after sowing seeds"
  - "A mutation in gene X will cause increased mortality in the common fruit fly"
  - "Gene Y is responsible for human intelligence."

## The process of inquiry
### 2. Formulate a hypothesis

- Perhaps the most difficult step in science!
- A good hypothesis will help you design your experiment correctly
- Always refer back to your hypothesis

## The process of inquiry
### 2. Formulate a hypothesis

Null hypothesis:

 - Posits that the explanatory variable we test does NOT affect our data
 - We test the null hypothesis: sufficient evidence to reject it?

Alternative hypothesis:

- Opposite of the Null hypothesis (the explanatory variable affects our data)
- We normally think in terms of an alternative hypothesis

## The process of inquiry
### 3. Design experiment

- What is the population we are interested in?
- How should we collect a sample that is relevant to that population?

## The process of inquiry
### 3. Design experiment

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Does the average flowering date of Snödroppssläktet differ between populations in Northern and Southern Sweden?

- Null hypothesis: the average flowering date **does not differ** between populations in Northern and Southern Sweden
- Alternative hypothesis: the average flowering date **does differ** between populations in Northern and Southern Sweden

## The process of inquiry
### 3. Design experiment

- Population: what we want to know something about
- Sample: what we are able to study
- Use the sample to learn something about the population

## The process of inquiry
### 4. Conduct the experiment (obtain data)

- Perform the experiment as planned
- Collect data systematically and accurately
- Randomisation to reduce bias

## The process of inquiry
### 5. Analyze the data

- What are the chances we would collect the data we did if the null hypothesis was true?
    - If the chance is sufficiently low, then we **reject the null hypothesis**
    - If the chance is high, then we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**

## The process of inquiry
### 5. Analyze the data

1. Calcualte the **observed test statistic** of our population
    - Decided by our initial hypothesis
    - Average (mean, median), spread (variance, sd, CV), difference in (mean, median, var, sd)
2. Create a null distribution of the test statistic (in a world where the null hypothesis is true)
    - What values of our test statistic could we observe?
    - If we kept taking new samples from our population and calculating our test statistic
3. Compare our **observed test statistic** with the null distribution

## The process of inquiry
### 5. Analyze the data

- What are the chances we would collect the data we did if the null hypothesis was true?
- What are the chances we would have observed our test statistic or a more extreme one, if the null hypothesis was correct?
- This probability is called a **p-value**
    - If the chance (p-value) is sufficiently low, then we **reject the null hypothesis**
    - If the chance (p-value) is high, then we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**

- What is high and low?

## The process of inquiry
### 5. Analyze the data

We want to find a balance between two types of errors we could make:

- $\alpha$: **type I error** (false positive)
    - Null hypothesis is TRUE, but we reject it
- $\beta$: **type II error** (false negative)
    - Null hypothesis is FALSE, but we fail to reject it

## The process of inquiry
### 5. Analyze the data

## The process of inquiry
### 5. Analyze the data

- To decrease our chance of making a **type I error** (false positive):
  - Decrease our $\alpha$
  - p = 0.05, p = 0.01, p = 0.001?
- However, this increases our chance of making a **type II error** (false negative):
- To decrease our chance of making a **type II error**:
  - Increase our sample size
  - Increase $\alpha$
- Can also view p-values as a continuum

## The process of inquiry
### 6. Formulate conclusion

- Describe your findings:
    - Describe outcomes of your statistics
    - In additional, translate those statistical outcomes back to the original hypothesis
    - Most of us are interested in biology, not p-values!

## The process of inquiry
### 7. Synthesize results with other studies, and determine next steps

- Compare findings with existing literature
- Propose future research directions or applications
- Other scientists replicate or build on your work?
